# face_landmark

A simple face aligment method, based on pytorch


## introduction


It is simple and flexible, trained with wingloss , multi task learning, also with data augmentation based on headpose and face attributes(eyes state and mouth state).

The model is trained for **[[pappa_pig_face_engine]](https://github.com/610265158/Peppa_Pig_Face_Engine).**
